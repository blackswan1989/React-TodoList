          Fight Club, 1999
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />Director, David Fincher
          <br />
          <br />
          Tyler, Brad Pitt
          <br />
          Narrator, Edward Norton
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />

          The unnamed Narrator is an automobile recall specialist who is
          unfulfilled by his job and possessions. He finds catharsis by posing
          as a sufferer of testicular cancer and other afflictions in support
          groups, curing his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another
          impostor, Marla Singer. The two agree to split which groups they
          attend.
          <br /><br />
          On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets soap
          salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his
          apartment and all his belongings have been destroyed by an explosion.
          He is disheartened by the loss of his material possessions. Deciding
          against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar.
          Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to consumerism. In the parking
          lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.
          <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
          Director David Fincher said Fight Club is a coming of age film, like
          the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher
          described the Narrator as an "everyman" the character is identified in
          the script as "Jack", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined
          the Narrator's background: "He's tried to do everything he was taught
          to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't." He
          cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in
          which he must "kill" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of
          the film, he has "killed off" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills
          his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the
          process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler
          Durden.
