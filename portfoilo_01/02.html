          <br />
          Atomic Blonde is a 2017 American action thriller film based on the
          2012 graphic novel The Coldest City, which revolves around a spy who
          has to find a list of double agents who are being smuggled into the
          West on the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
          <br /><br /><br /><br />
          In November 1989, just days prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall,
          MI6 agent James Gascoigne is shot and killed by KGB agent Yuri
          Bakhtin, who steals The List, a microfilm document concealed in
          Gascoigne's wristwatch that contains the names of every intelligence
          agent (on both sides) active in Berlin. Ten days later, Lorraine
          Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6
          executive Eric Gray and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her
          just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debrief
          room and flashbacks to Lorraine's time in Berlin.
          <br /><br /><br /><br />
          From the start, Leitch felt that using the right songs for the project
          was crucial. Part of this was attempting to answer the question "How
          do you reinvent this stuffy Cold War spy movie?" The soundtrack uses a
          combination of 1980s songs as well as covers of them. The latter were
          used to add "a contemporized feeling of the '80s".
          <br /><br />The movie's producers were initially worried that they
          would not be able to get the rights to all the songs that Leitch
          wanted to use, but Leitch himself estimated that around 75% of his
          picks made it into the final product. Though the Berlin Wall fell in
          1989, the concentration of iconic songs was from the first half of the
          1980s, with the exception of George Michael's 1988 chart-topping
          Father Figure, which itself was Leitch's second choice after the 1986
          release Take My Breath Away by Berlin.
