          Nina Sayers is a 28-year-old dancer in a New York City ballet company,
          which is preparing to open its new season with Tchaikovsky's Swan
          Lake. With prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre being forced into
          retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for
          a new dancer to portray the dual role of the innocent White Swan and
          the sensual Black Swan. Nina auditions for the role and gives a
          flawless performance as the White Swan, but fails to embody the Black
          Swan.
          <br /><br />
          During rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe new dancer Lily, whom
          he describes as possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina lacks.
          Nina also falls victim to several hallucinations of a doppelg√§nger
          following her wherever she goes and finds unexplained scratch marks on
          her back. One night, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to dinner despite
          Erica's objections.
          <br /><br /><br /><br />
          Black Swan had its world premiere as the opening film at the 67th
          Venice Film Festival on September 1, 2010. It received a standing
          ovation whose length Variety said made it "one of the strongest Venice
          openers in recent memory". The festival's artistic director Marco
          Mueller had chosen Black Swan over The American (starring George
          Clooney) for opening film, saying, "[It] was just a better fit ...
          Clooney is a wonderful actor, and he will always be welcome in Venice.
          But it was as simple as that."
          <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
          Black Swan appeared on many critics' top ten lists of 2010 and is
          frequently considered to be one of the best films of the year. It was
          featured on the American Film Institute's 10 Movies of the Year. On
          January 25, 2011 the film was nominated for five Academy Awards (Best
          Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography and Best
          Film Editing) and won one for Portman's performance.
